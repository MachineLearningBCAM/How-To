# Introduction

This is a basic guide on how to add Gurobi solver to cvx. 

# Get the Licence

First of all we need to get the licence to use Gurobi.
We go to [Gurobi Register](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/) and register in the website to get an account.
In the university section, we can just write BCAM.
Once the account is created, just go to [Gurobi Licence Registration](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/) again and accept the conditions.
You will recieve an Academic Licence Detail, we need to copy the number **cvx_grbgetkey xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx**, it is the number of our licence key.

# Download Gurobi

We can download the cvx with all the solvers in the page [Download cvx](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/).
We do not need to do anything different from when we download cvx.

# Use Gurobi Solver

To start using Gurobi solver, we need to open `/cvx/gurobi/maci64/grbgetkey`. We will get the following message:

    Enter the Key Code for the license you are activating
    (format is xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx):

Just paste the number of the licence.
